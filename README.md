  <h1>Circe</h1>
</div>

Circe is a programming language designed for extreme simplicity and extreme performance. It uses an English-based syntax, so the learning curve is very low. It compiles directly to machine code, which (along with its intense optimizations) results in very fast execution times.

Under the hood, Circe is made up of a few different components:

- The Circe parser, which generates an AST from the source code.
- The Circe Inference Engine (CIE), which uses a massive collection of descriptions and default configurations to convert an AST to Circe IR.
- Circe IR, which is a low-level intermediate representation of the code.
- The Circe Compiler, which converts Circe IR to machine code.

## Progress

Circe is just a hobby project, so it's not going to be finished any time soon. However, I am open to contributions, so if you want to help, feel free to do so.
